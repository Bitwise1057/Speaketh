# Speaketh

**Version 1.0.4** | Roleplay Language Addon for World of Warcraft | *By BattRatt*

---

This addon is inspired by Tongues, which has been broken for some time. Initially meant to replicate it, Speaketh grew into something more: a full lore-accurate language system built from Blizzard's own in-game language tables.

## Features

### Languages and Translation

- **20+ built-in languages:** Common, Orcish, Thalassian, Darnassian, Taurahe, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Forsaken, Zandali, Draenei, Goblin, Shath'Yar, Draconic, Demonic, Nerubian, Nazja, Shalassian, Vrykul, Vulpera, Gilnean, and Pandaren
- **Custom languages:** create your own language from a pool of words you define
- **Custom language sharing:** generate a compact import code for any custom language and share it with other players; they paste the code in and the language is added to their addon instantly

### Dialects

- **Built-in dialects:** Gilnean, Troll, and more, applied on top of any active language
- **Drunk dialect:** four levels of drunkenness (Sober, Tipsy, Drunk, Smashed) that slur and distort your speech
- **Custom dialects:** build your own accent using word-swap rules

### Fluency

- **Per-language fluency (0-100%):** the higher your fluency, the more of your speech comes through clearly to other Speaketh users
- **Passive learning:** optionally gain fluency over time just by hearing a language spoken
- **Listener-based decoding:** two listeners can hear the same message very differently depending on how well each of them knows the language

### Multiplayer

- **Works across party, raid, guild, and whisper:** other Speaketh users decode your speech at their own fluency level, while players without the addon see only the scrambled text
- **Works in /say and /yell:** even players not in your group can understand you if they have the addon and know the language
- **Non-disruptive:** players without the addon simply see the translated text as written, just like normal language scrambling in WoW

### Other

- **Passthrough words:** define words that are never translated regardless of language, useful for character names and in-game terms
- **Minimap button:** access your language and settings at a glance
- **Floating language HUD:** a small draggable label showing your active language
